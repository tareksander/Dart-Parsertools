## lexer_builder example

This shows how to create a simple lexer with lexer_builder.  
  

Use `dart run` to test and `dart run build_runner build` to regenerate the lexer after modifying the annotations.  
  
You don't necessarily need to check the generated code into git, it is done here, so you may take a look at it without building it yourself.
